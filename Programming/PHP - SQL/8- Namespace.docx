Namespaces are a system that are supposed to tackle any potential conflict that would arise from two classes or functions that are named the same. A namespace file is typically called like namespace.ns.php

It is inspired by the libraries present in C++ or Python. Here, instead of the libraries, we are talking about folders. A folder that contains the definitions of functions, classes or constants is a namespace. 

When you do this

You are declaring your new namespace, by inserting the code on line 2 at the beginning. 

Anytime you will call strlen, it will display hello world instead of the original purpose

If you want to call the original strlen function, put a backslash in front:
\strlen()

Writing several namespaces


__Namespace__ : constant that returns the name of the namespace you are currently in.

Declaring a subnamespace

namespace A/B: namespace B in A

Accessing a different namespace

Specify the name of the namespace followed by \ followed by the function :

\A\B\function()

This functin is called in an absolute manner.

This introduces us to the concept of the scope  of a namespace. Just like we use $this in OOP, we can use namespace before a function to call it inside the namespace

namespace\function()

Creating aliases
If you have too many inclusive namespaces, use an alias:

use A\B\C\D as nsF

We can see that use is what require is to scripts.
